Dear Mr. Smith,

I am submitting my resume for consideration for the summer application design internship program at ABC Company. Given the skills and experience outlined in my enclosed resume, I believe I will be a worthy asset to your team.

In my three years at XYZ College, I’ve completed a great deal of coursework on cutting-edge design trends and best practices, including Principles of User Experience Design and Mobile Application Design, where I learned and applied skills such as user journey mapping, application wire framing and designing software for a variety of mobile devices and operating systems.

In addition, I spent the past semester volunteering my time with a local non-profit that collects donated clothes and furniture and redistributes it to families in need. I helped the web team update and re-launch an application that allows people in the community to locate nearby drop-off points and schedule pick-ups.

Finally, my two years working as a barista at the student centre has taught me the importance of building a convenient and memorable consumer experience that aligns with the brand. It also helped me grow my skills in team collaboration, verbal communication and project leadership.

I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team. This internship would help me grow my real-world experience in the technology industry and help me further develop and refine my application design skills.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
Erica Garcia


Dear Ms. Smith,

I am writing to apply for the scientific research summer internship position that was listed in the Anytown University Career Services Office. I believe my research and conservation experience make me an ideal candidate.

I have had a great deal of research experience in chemistry, biology, and geology, both in the lab and in the field. Most of my experience is in environmental field studies. I am currently conducting research in our school's outdoor laboratory to assess the water quality of a nearby pond. I know water quality assessment is a component of this internship, and I know my previous experience makes me a prime candidate for this.

Last summer, I worked as a conservation assistant at the National Trust's Clumber Park. Along with trail maintenance and building, I also served as a research assistant for the research organisation at the park. I conducted an analysis of soil samples, and input data from various research projects. I received a special commendation from the director of the research organisation for my attention to detail and dedication to research.

I believe that I would be an asset to your program. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist your organisation and to expand my research skills.

I will call next week to see if you agree that my qualifications seem to be a match for the position. If so, I hope to schedule an interview at a mutually convenient time. I look forward to speaking with you.

Thank you for your consideration,

Sincerely,
Joseph Q. Applicant

Dear Mr. Scheck,

I would like to apply for a summer internship position with Innovation. I learned of your company through the placement centre at University of Missouri.

I am currently majoring in architecture at the University of Missouri and will receive my degree this spring. While I have a comprehensive architectural background, my emphasis is on rehabilitation and renovation. I feel that your firm places prominence in similar areas and having the privilege of serving as an intern with you will give me that further exposure I need to advance my career.

Upon graduating, I hope to work for a firm that specializes in rehabilitation and renovation architectural development and eventually start my own firm. With the right opportunities and experience to cutting edge projects and designs, I believe I can achieve this goal. I hope to with your firm’s help.

I previously held a summer internship at Smithers & Associates, a St. Louis-based architecture firm. While there, I used CAD technology to help design floor plans for a multi-level retail space. I also used the drafting techniques I learned on the Digital Terrain Monitor (DTM) to assist on the redesign of a movie theatre in downtown St. Louis. This could be of interest to you, as I recently read on your website that Innovations will be renovating three entertainment venues in the coming year.

I would like the opportunity to meet with you to discuss any internship opportunities you might have. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see some work samples. You can reach me by phone at (444) 536-1212 or by email at cwatkins@email.com.

Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely,
Chandra Watkins

Dear Ruben,

I am sending you this mail to ask you to consider me as an intern for the second half of 2020. I can imagine that you receive quite a few applications so I will try to keep this brief. 

My name is Do?a Gönüllü (1992). I’m originally from Istanbul, Turkey but have been living in the Netherlands for the last couple of years. I started my studies in Istanbul at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University before transferring to ArtEZ Arnhem. I have been interested in editorial design for quite some time and this interest grew over the time I have been studying in the Netherlands. 

I was first acquainted with your work in 2013 with the identity design of the 13th Istanbul Biennale. It was a specific time in my life - like every other Turkish citizen who were involved in the Gezi Protests - and this work showed me two different sides of design, the ethical and the un-ethical, something that I had never considered before.

Currently one of my interests is the use of archival books as an imitation technique. There is something quite intriguing that while a book can act as a placeholder of the original, it can become something more than just a repetition, an object of its own. 

Besides focusing on representations in book design, I’ve recently started researching representations of ourselves in digital media, how this affects our (social) behaviour and how graphic design can help us realise the weight of our decisions when it comes to this issue.

I have admired your approach to design not only from the perspective of a designer but also a writer and a researcher for some time now and I think it is quite unique for a designer to produce their own work. I would love the opportunity to learn from you.

I would like to invite you to take a look at my website (link below) to see some of my recent work. You will find a selection of books, research based projects and essays. 

If you have any questions or want more information about certain projects please let me know. 

All the best,
Do?a Gönüllü

Dear Roger,

I started my studies in Istanbul at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University before transferring to ArtEZ Arnhem. I have been interested in books and bookmaking for quite some time and this interest grew over the time I have been studying in the Netherlands. 

I am especially interested in books as objects; the idea of making a book that doesn’t just carry and communicate information but can also stand and live on its own. I tend to gravitate towards artists and photography books. Books that are not mere vessels of information but a form of exhibition space. The relationship between designer and artist and how this interaction plays a role in the creation of the eventual design is something that fascinates me. From what I know of your work it would be a great opportunity for me to work for you.

Dear Rob,

I am sending you this mail to ask you to consider me as an intern for the second half of 2020. I can imagine that you receive quite a few applications so I will try to keep this brief. 

My name is Doğa Gönüllü (1992). I’m originally from Istanbul, Turkey but have been living in the Netherlands for the last couple of years. I started my studies in Istanbul at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University before transferring to ArtEZ Arnhem. I have been interested in editorial design for quite some time and this interest grew over the time I have been studying in the Netherlands. 

I’m specifically interested in artists and archival books. The purpose of these books usually is to be a simulation of the real thing, a placeholder, yet within the process they become something more than just a repetition, an object of its own. I think within this context, usage of images, typography, materials of a book becomes highly interesting and important. I would like to learn more in-depth within this field in the coming year. I admire that you work on projects that are relative to the present, are interesting and with content that matters but also that you started your own publishing house that focuses on artist books, photo books and research projects, making them available to everyone. I believe it would be a great opportunity for me to learn from you.

Dear Gavillet&Ci

My name is Shirin Pfisterer, a third year graphic design student at Artez Arnhem, the Netherlands. In the upcoming semester, I get the opportunity to apply what I have learned so far and get practical experiences. I am writing to you because I would like to apply for an Internship coming August until December 2017.

In the last year, I am more engaged with typography: how can typefaces be used with media and how can type support images, empower or even replace an image. With these ideas in mind,
I created projects that I recently published on my portfolio web- site. Your studio has great success and created many projects to be impressed by, but what I personally admire the most is the direct influence from art. I believe the fading border between art and design empowers both fields and creates situations and moments that are very raw and powerful. It is these kinds of work that sparked my interest in graphic design.

I am convinced that an internship at Gavillet&Ci would give me the opportunity to apply my fascination for type and image whilst letting me experiment with a playful roughness, allowing it to become a characteristic of my work.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and hope that we could get to know each other personally and talk about the possibility of an internship.

Greetings from the Netherlands 
Shirin Pfisterer

Dear John Smith,

I am writing in regards of the vacancy for the consultancy internship with PwC, as advertised on RateMyPlacement. Please find my CV attached.

I am particularly drawn to this internship at PwC because of its concentration on sustainability and climate change consultancy. PwC is the market-leader in this field, and I am fascinated by the strategies PwC puts in place to help an organisation meet its social and environmental goals. I have been reading about PwC’s recent project, involving the implementation of new sustainability procedures in government buildings across the UK. My involvement in the ‘Clear Up Our Campus’ campaign at university was similar, and makes me a perfect candidate for this internship.
​
As my CV describes, I am two years into a Sustainable Engineering degree, achieving high grades in modules that focussed on sustainable planning in urban environment. My studies have imparted a groundwork of knowledge, and analytical skills that are crucial for a career in this field of consultancy. I also have three years of work experience at The Bear Factory, which has imparted great collaborative skills.

Thank you for considering my application, I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the programme further in an interview.

Yours Sincerely,
Your Name

Dear Mr. Watkins,
 
I was truly elated when my student project on cash flow improvement won the first prize in a local business club contest. Two months after that, my solution was implemented at a construction company where it cut change orders processing time by 20%.
 
I must admit it was no random win, though. I always had a strong desire to pursue a career as a leader in the finance function. As I believe the only way of reaching this goal is through adopting a results-oriented attitude reflected in initiative and accountability, I used my time at university to develop these. I also gained hands-on quantitative, analytical, and problem-solving skills by completing such courses as:
Statistical Inference in Management 
Analytical Methods for Business
Business Communication
 
I would love to demonstrate to you that my GPA of 3.98 doesn’t just show my commitment to learning but also reflects my inherent passion for finances and propensity to grow among like-minded people.
 
When Professor James Henry told me about an internship opportunity with TD Finance, I knew this was an unmissable occasion for further growth, surrounded by outstanding financial professionals.
 
Could we schedule an appointment next week to discuss how I could contribute to the Finance Leadership Development Program and help your company find optimal solutions to its current business needs?
 
Best regards,
Peter Thurlow
